# Trabajo-Terminal-Mod-Monitoreo
 Code necessary to configure a DSPIC30F4013 microcontroller to communicate via UART2 with a 4G-LTE LARA-R2 IoT module. The UART1 is also configured for microcontroller-sensor MCP39F511A communication, a state machine was implemented that discards those bytes belonging to parameters that are not going to be monitored.
